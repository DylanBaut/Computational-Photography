This Flight_Tracking system utiizes a 
python jupyter notebook which is used to preprocess an mp4 tracking video of a flying object.
Follow the steps within the notebook to convert the video to frames, then to panoramic image.
Use the ONNX file for fying object detection across key frames, and then graph out result. 

Note: ML data, Airplane/drone data, and Frames are not included to fit within Zip size constraint
